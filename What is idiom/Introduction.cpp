/*
 * What is C++ idiom?
 * 
 * In terms of programming, an idiom is essentially
 * "How to". It's a way to do something or solve 
 * some problem in a particular language. 
 * 
 * Unlike patterns that are language independent 
 * (agnostic), idiom Ñ–s:
 * - language specific;
 * - more low level;
 * - related to some feature or deficiency of a language.
 * 
 * So, idiom solves a common problem in a language, while pattern 
 * solves a commmon problem in programming in general.
